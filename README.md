# BMI-Calculator
I created this website as a practice to my flexbox skills and division styles. As a learner of front-end development, I will keep creating websites and deploy here at github to show my further or current skills. I created the project in a span of 2 days. 

Making progress makes me consistent and motivated when learning front-end development.
